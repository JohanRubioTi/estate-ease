# Full-Stack Real Estate Website using MERN and Refine

This is a full-stack real estate website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and Refine, with Material UI 5 for the front-end styling. This application also features a REST API on a backend server, allowing users to publish new properties, create custom profiles, and access a dashboard with ApexCharts for analytics. Additionally, this application includes a chat feature and Google Login for added convenience.
